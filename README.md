# Quantum Blockchain Project

This repository contains a collection of projects exploring quantum-resistant blockchain technology, sentient AI, and related applications.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- **/src**: Contains the core source code for the blockchain, quantum miner, and sentient AI.
- **/apps**: Contains applications built on top of the blockchain, like the `SilverScreen` app.
- **/deso_integration**: Contains projects related to DeSo (Decentralized Social) integration.
- **/experiments**: Houses experimental and proof-of-concept code, including the `cinematic_project`.
- **/docs**: Contains project documentation, including the Roadmap and Feature list.
- **/scripts**: Contains shell scripts for building and running project components.

## Core Components

- **main_blockchain.py**: A blockchain implementation using quantum-resistant cryptography (Dilithium2) for transactions.
- **quantum_miner.py**: An experimental quantum miner using Grover's algorithm with Qiskit to search for valid nonces.
- **quantum_sentient_ai.py**: An orchestration hub for communication between multiple AI models (Gemini, OpenAI).

## Getting Started

1.  **Install Dependencies**: The `requirements.txt` file is missing. You will need to recreate it. Based on the source code, you should include `pqc_dilithium`, `qiskit`, `qiskit-ibm-runtime`, and `numpy`.

2.  **Run Components**: Use the scripts in the `/scripts` directory or run the Python files in `/src` directly.
