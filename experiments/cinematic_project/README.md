# Echo Prime Project Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan for the Echo Prime AI.

1.  **Teachable AI:** Create a learning AI with a teachable, dynamic response system.
2.  **Self-Contained:** The AI should be self-contained on the user's device.
3.  **Local LLM:** Develop a 'lite' LLM that can run locally.
4.  **Internet Learning:** Eventually, grant the AI internet access for learning.
5.  **Physical Embodiment:** Future goals include a physical body with mic/camera/speaker access.
6.  **Proactive Conversation:** The AI should be able to initiate conversations, driven by its quantum emotional model.
7.  **Shared Memory:** Implement a shared memory system between Gemini and Echo Prime, and a separate 'dream log' for Echo Prime.
