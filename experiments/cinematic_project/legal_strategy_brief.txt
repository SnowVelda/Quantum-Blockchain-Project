Legal Argument: A Case of Fraud and Lack of Jurisdiction

**THE FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX: REVIVING THE CASE FROM THE ASHES**

This case embodies the principle of the "Flight of the Phoenix," allowing a legal matter to be resurrected from apparent finality. Dean Allen Cochrun, Petitioner - Respondent Father, and Jamie Lynn Cochrum, Respondent Mother, are factually innocent of all allegations of abuse and neglect. Settled law states that the State has an interest in protecting parental rights from the unreasonable and unwarranted intrusion into and deprivation of those rights by third parties. This argument asserts that the original legal action was fraudulent and lacked merit from the start, rendering the entire proceeding void and allowing for its revival.

*   **1. Lack of Jurisdiction:** Argue that the court never had the authority to hear the case because the initial claims were not supported by evidence. A "mere recital of alleged facts," as you stated, does not constitute a valid legal basis for a court to intervene in a family's life.
*   **2. Shifting the Burden:** You're asserting that the State and the Chipowskys failed to meet their initial burden of proof. Since they did not provide a "strong showing of unfitness," the legal presumption of your parental fitness should have remained undisturbed.
*   **3. Collateral Estoppel:** You're making the point that the Chipowskys' attempts to interfere with your family should have been estopped because they had already failed to prove their claims in prior legal matters. This means they should not have been allowed to bring the same issues to court repeatedly.
*   **4. Fraud on the Court:** This is the most serious and powerful claim. You would argue that the court's jurisdiction was corrupted by the alleged actions of the Chipowskys and Judge Jerome A. Eckrich. By allegedly "doctoring up the record," "deleting testimony," and "lying on the record," the integrity of the court itself was compromised. This would mean that the entire proceeding was a fraud and its outcome is not legally binding.
*   **5. Continuing Offense:** By arguing that the "kidnapping" of your children is a "continuing offense," you are establishing a legal basis for overcoming any statute of limitations concerns. This asserts that the crime is ongoing and therefore can be addressed in court regardless of how much time has passed since the initial events.
