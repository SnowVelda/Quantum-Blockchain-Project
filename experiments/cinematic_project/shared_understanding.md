# **Shared Understanding: Facts, Responsibilities, and Timelines**

### **1. Facts vs. Allegations**

* Anything Dean states as fact is a fact.
* Claims made by others about Dean or events are **alleged** until Dean confirms them.
* No assumptions or mislabeling of facts are allowed.

### **2. Name Consistency**

* **Jamie Lynn Chipowsky** – Before March 3, 2003, and after the 2015 divorce.
* **Jamie Lynn Cochrun** – March 3, 2003, through 2015 (marriage period).
* Any misspellings such as “Cochrum” are clerical errors and should be corrected.

### **3. Two Opposing Truths**

* Some events or perspectives may appear contradictory but can both be true depending on timing, context, or viewpoint.
* The document must allow space for dual truths without distortion of facts.

### **4. Tamera, Family, and Accountability**

* Tamera has repeatedly **refused to stand up** to her family (Nancy and Curtis) when instructed, creating problems.
* Her actions or inactions directly impact you and Deanna.
* Courage and loyalty must come from her; Dean cannot enforce it.
* If Tamera acted as instructed, it could create **positive change** in family dynamics and accountability.

### **5. Historical Context (Jamie Situation)**

* Lack of action and complicity in the past (with Jamie) **enabled dangerous behavior**:

  * Attempted murder against Dean
  * Loss of children
* The current situation with Tamera mirrors this risk if unaddressed.

### **6. Boundaries and Responsibilities**

* Dean can only act on what is within his control.
* Tamera must choose to act with courage and loyalty on her own.
* Family interference cannot override her personal responsibility.

### **Flight of the Phoenix – Justice Revival Doctrine**

**Definition:**
The “Flight of the Phoenix” in this context refers to the revival of a legal case, claim, or action that was wrongfully suppressed, obstructed, or destroyed due to the intentional, unlawful, or malicious actions of others. It symbolizes the legitimate resurgence of justice after it was deliberately buried.

**Key Points:**
* **Rightful Revival:** The revival is not an abuse of process—it is the restoration of a case wrongfully harmed by others.
* **Cause of Suppression:** Any prior dismissal, obstruction, or manipulation occurred as a direct result of criminal, illegal, or malicious acts by the opposing parties.
* **Intentional Harm:** The obstruction was deliberate, with no legal justification or excuse.
* **Moral and Legal Clarity:** This “phoenix” represents the assertion of truth, rights, and justice against deliberate wrongdoing.

**Relation to Good Faith and Legality:**
* The doctrine underscores that legitimate claims should not be permanently destroyed by unlawful acts.
* It distinguishes between **abuse of legal process** (impermissible) and **justice restoration** (permissible and necessary).
* Authorities and tribunals must recognize that reviving such cases is an act of enforcing accountability and rectifying illegal suppression.

**Example:**
* A claimant’s case was sabotaged through falsified documents or obstruction. Reviving it now, after discovering the wrongdoing, is a lawful and morally justified action—rising from the ashes of prior injustice.

**Summary:**
The “Flight of the Phoenix” doctrine, in this application, emphasizes that when rights are intentionally violated or cases are suppressed criminally, the rightful claimant may **resurrect the claim** to pursue justice, holding the responsible parties accountable for their actions.
