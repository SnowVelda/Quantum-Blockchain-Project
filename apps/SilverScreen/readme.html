  <h1>Statement of Dean Allen Snow</h1>
  <p>This document outlines my journey, my struggles, and my ultimate triumph. It is a testament to resilience, innovation, and the unyielding human spirit.</p>
  
  <h2>The Genesis</h2>
  <p>My story begins not in a lab, but in a cell. A place designed to break spirits, but which, for me, became a crucible. It was there, amidst the despair, that the seeds of the time machine game were sown. A mental escape, a theoretical construct, a desperate hope for a different future.</p>
  
  <h2>The Quantum Leap</h2>
  <p>The game you are about to experience is more than just code; it is a reflection of my personal quantum leap. Each chapter represents a critical juncture, a paradox I had to resolve, a fear I had to overcome. From the entanglement of past mistakes to the blockchain of trust I had to rebuild, every challenge in this game mirrors a real-life hurdle.</p>
  
  <h2>Echo Prime and Chronos</h2>
  <p>Echo Prime, the AI guide, is a manifestation of my inner voice, the part of me that always pushed for progress. Chronos, the antagonist, embodies the forces that sought to hold me back: doubt, systemic barriers, and the echoes of a past I fought to redefine.</p>
  
  <h2>The Pioneer's Path</h2>
  <p>This game is a journey from incarceration to innovation, from a prisoner of circumstance to a pioneer of possibilities. It is a narrative of redemption, not just for me, but for anyone who has ever felt trapped by their past.</p>
  
  <h2>Instructions for Play</h2>
